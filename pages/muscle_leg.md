The leg muscles, which are numerous, can be divided into three primary compartments: the anterior, lateral, and posterior compartments, with the latter, further subdivided into a deep and superficial compartment. Generally, the muscles located in the lower leg are involved in ankle joint movements.

- [Superficial Posterior Compartment](/muscle/leg/superficialposterior)
  - [Gastrocnemius](/muscle/leg/gastrocnemius/)
    - [Lateral Head Of Gastrocnemius](/muscle/leg/lateralheadofgastrocnemius/)
    - [Medial Head Of Gastrocnemius](/muscle/leg/medialheadofgastrocnemius/)
  - [Soleus](/muscle/leg/soleus/)
  - [Plantaris](/muscle/leg/plantaris/)
- [Deep Posterior Compartment](/muscle/leg/deepposterior)
  - [Popliteus](/muscle/leg/popliteus/)
  - [Flexor Digitorum Longus](/muscle/leg/flexordigitorumlongus/)
  - [Flexor Hallucis Longus](/muscle/leg/flexorhallucislongus/)
  - [Tibialis Posterior](/muscle/leg/tibialisposterior/)
- [Lateral Compartment](/muscle/leg/lateral/)
  - [Fibularis Longus](/muscle/leg/fibularislongus/)
  - [Fibularis Brevis](/muscle/leg/fibularisbrevis/)
- [Anterior Compartment](/muscle/leg/anterior)
  - [Tibialis Anterior](/muscle/leg/tibialisanterior/)
  - [Extensor Digitorum Longus](/muscle/leg/extensordigitorumlongus/)
