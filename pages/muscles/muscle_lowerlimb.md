The lower limb compises the hip, thigh, knee, leg, ankle and foot. Here we list the muscles of the hip, thigh and leg. From top to bottom it comprises the following bones: saccrum, coccyx, hipbone (ilium, ischium, and pubis), femur, patella, fibula, tibia and the skelteton of the foot. In humans the lower limbs must support the entire weight of the body while walking, running, or jumping, etc.
