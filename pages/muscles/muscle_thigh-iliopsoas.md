The iliopsoas, a muscle complex that does not contribute to leg extension at the knee joint, is made up of two distinct muscles: the psoas major and the iliacus. These muscles originate in the pelvis, travel beneath the inguinal ligament, and converge in the anterior compartment of the thigh to form a shared tendon.
