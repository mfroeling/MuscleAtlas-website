This website was started together with the [muscle quality index project](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/nwo-talent-programme/projects-vidi/vidi-2020){:target="_blank"}. On this website you will find information about projects related to quantitative muscle analysis aimed to describe muscle architecture, status, and microstructure. With the projects on the website we aim to link quantitative MRI measurements of muscle to muscle function. Quantitative analysis of muscle architecture and function can be used for evaluating the health and strength of the muscles and monitoring changes over time. This will lead to a better evaluation of disease progression and therapy in muscle disease.
